Book Shelf Frontend
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
npm run dev

# Node version
18.17.0 
You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
